## Game is...
<p style="text-align:justify">
    How to make a game? A lot of my friends have asked this question. But before we start, we need to know what the definition of a game is. If you ask your teacher, you'll probably get an explanation about an activity that will make you lazy or an activity that the teacher provides to make the learning process more fun. If you ask your coach, he'll probably be thinking about sports. If you ask your friend, it could be something like <a href="https://m.mobilelegends.com/"> Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</a>. After all, game definition is a bit complicated depends on who you ask. Here is a game definiton in one sentence that I simplify from dictioanry in one sentence:
</p>

> A game is an activity that is undertaken for enjoyment, with the goal of achieving a specific outcome or challenge.

    To begin with here is a picture that simplify what game is. Tug of War, is an easy game, you pull harder until one side go to the "lose zone". But that's not as simple as that to describe it, there is more.
</p>

> Tug of war is a physical game that is played by two teams who stand on opposite ends of a rope and pull on it, with  the goal of pulling the other team across a dividing line or over a designated point. The game is typically played on a flat, level surface, and each team must have an equal number of players.

> The teams take turns pulling on the rope, with the goal of either pulling the other team across a dividing line or over a designated point, or of holding their ground and preventing the other team from making progress. The team that is able to pull the other team across the line or over the designated point is declared the winner.

    You can't explain a game with one sentence. Because the game is too complicated activity that the creator made, even the simplest one such a Tug of War. There's must be <b>Rules</b> that prevent player cheating, what if the dividing line isn't in the very middle? What if the team A have more player than team B? What's the win and lose condition. Complicated isn't?
