## Game is...
<p style="text-align:justify">
   How to make a game? Lot of my friends have asked this question. But before we start, we need to know what the definition of a game is. If you ask your teacher, you'll probably get an explanation about an activity that will make you lazy or an activity that the teacher provides to make the learning process more fun. If you ask your coach, he'll probably be thinking about sports. If you ask your friend, it could be something Mobile Legends: Bang Bang. Game definition is a bit complicated depending on who you ask.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
    Here is a game definition in one sentence that I simplify from dictionary in one sentence:
</p>
    
> A game is an activity that is undertaken for enjoyment, with the goal of achieving a specific outcome or challenge.
<p style="text-align:justify">
    And here is a game definition by IGDA (International Game Developers Association):
</p>

> A play activity with rules that involves conflict.

<p style="text-align:justify">
    To begin with, here is an example that we could learn from IGDA definition of what game is. Tug of War is an easy game, you pull harder until one side goes to the "lose zone". But that's not as simple as that to describe it, there is more.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
    Here are the rules that commonly used in Tug of War:
</p>

- Tug of war is a sport in which two teams of equal numbers pull on opposite ends of a rope, with the goal of pulling the other team across a central line or into a pit.
- Each team has a designated side of the rope and must stay within a set distance from the rope.
- The rope must be made of hemp or a similar natural material and have a minimum circumference of 10 inches (25 cm) and a minimum width of 2 inches (5 cm).
- The game is typically played on a field of dirt or grass, with a central line or pit marking the boundary between the teams.
- The match begins with both teams holding the rope and standing on the starting line.
- The teams then pull on the rope with the goal of moving the rope and the opposing team across the central line or into the pit.
- A team wins the round if they successfully pull the other team across the central line or into the pit, or if the opposing team steps outside of the designated zone or drops the rope.

    Why do you need so many rules for simple games as Tug of War? The explanation is easy, to make it as a fair game. What would happen if there were no equal numbers on each team? Why should we use specific rope? Should we play this game on snow field? Mostly the rules are about game balance which I’ll discuss later on another blog. 
</p>

<p style="text-allign:justify">
    I restate again, this is just the rules for Tug of War. So, imagine how numerus rules do you need for GTA V, Mobile Legends, Free Fire, and PUBG. What kind of player movement will be implemented, what kind of activity that player should do, what happens if they lose or win, what happens if the player isn’t happy, many more. It’s complicated isn’t?
