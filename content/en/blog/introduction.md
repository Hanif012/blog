## This website is certainly one of the website ever made
The year is 2022, lot of achievment and dissapointment, the nice memory, the bad memory, the struggle, the pain, that I went through. Ok, i just want to share my knowledge, my path, my books collection, my thought, my vision. Someday i probably lost, someday i probably die, someday I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and unsure of what to do. I create this static website on github because of this, in the future probably im hosting it on aws. I don't know honestly. Just enjoy reader. Peace, FNH

## My Goal is beyond your understanding
