## This Website Is Certainly One Of The Website Ever Made
<p style="text-align:justify">
    As we enter the year 2023, it's clear that the past year has been full of both achievements and disappointments, as well as a range of memories – both good and bad. I've faced my share of struggles and challenges, and there have been times when I've felt overwhelmed and unsure of what to do. But through it all, I've tried to stay focused on my goals and keep moving forward.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
    One way I've chosen to share my experiences, knowledge, and thoughts with others is by creating a static website on GitHub. I'm excited about the opportunity to share my collection of books, my vision for the future, and my unique perspective with a wider audience. And who knows – maybe someday I'll even host this site on AWS and take it to the next level.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
    For now, I just want to invite you, dear reader, to join me on this journey and see where it takes us. Whether you're looking for inspiration, guidance, or just something interesting to read, I hope you'll find something of value on my website. And most importantly, I hope you'll find a sense of inspiration and enjoyment as you explore its contents. Here's to a bright and fulfilling future!

<p style="text-align:justify">
    This blog is about me and the world that we are living. I will post what I love, what I want. If you notice, the homepage button is a cat, I don't have a time to make a nice logo for my blog. Just ignore it, lol. I made this blog using <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>  and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> It's free and easy. You could find all resource(source code) that I'm using on my github. You could provide your suggestion on my pull request.

    Based on my thought that i write, my blog will be divided into:  
</p>

### As a Creative Outlet
<p style="text-align:justify">
    There are lot of things that i'm interested into. And blogging can be a creative outlet for individuals who enjoy writing and want to express their thoughts, ideas, and experiences in a more structured and organized way. Blogging allows individuals to create a platform for sharing their unique perspective and voice with a wider audience, and it can be a rewarding and fulfilling way to connect with others and share ideas.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
    Basicly, in this part, I'll be pouring my personal experience into my writing, sharing the lessons and insights that I've gained through my own life experiences. One of the things I love about being a creative is the constantly evolving nature of my work. Right now, I'm in the midst of a really exciting project that's keeping me on my toes. I'm always looking for new ways to challenge myself and push my creative boundaries, and this project is definitely doing that. I can't wait to share more updates with you as the project progresses and to see where it takes me next. Stay tuned for more insights and updates on what I'm currently working on!
</p>

### Sharing Insight
<p style="text-align:justify">
    As someone who has read a lot of books, I know firsthand how difficult it can be to remember everything that I've read. However, I've found that by sharing some of the important quotes and insights that I've encountered, I am able to better understand and retain the knowledge that I've gained. Sharing knowledge has many benefits, including improving understanding, fostering collaboration, stimulating creativity, and promoting personal growth and development. By sharing the quotes and insights that I've gained from my reading, I hope to contribute to the collective knowledge and understanding of others, and to help others to better remember and apply the valuable lessons and insights that they've encountered.

## End
<p style="text-align:justify">
    As we come to the end of this post, I hope that you've found my blog to be beneficial and informative. Sharing knowledge is something that is important to me, and I'm glad to have the opportunity to share my thoughts and insights with you. While I can't predict the future, I will do my best to keep up with the blog and post new content at least twice a month. I hope you'll continue to follow along and engage with me on this journey of sharing knowledge and ideas. Thank you for reading!
